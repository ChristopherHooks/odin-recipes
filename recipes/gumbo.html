    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken and sausage gumbo is a hearty, flavorful stew that originates from Louisiana, combining a rich blend of
        Cajun and Creole influences. The dish typically features chicken and smoked sausage, often andouille, simmered
        in a thick, savory roux made from flour and oil. It is seasoned with a mix of aromatic vegetables like bell
        peppers, onions, celery, and garlic, along with spices such as thyme, cayenne pepper, and bay leaves. The gumbo
        is then cooked with stock, sometimes enriched with tomatoes, and served over a bed of white rice. The result is
        a comforting, slightly spicy dish with deep, complex flavors that showcase the essence of Southern cooking.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 cups water</li>
        <li>3 pounds chicken parts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds okra</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pound andouille sausage, sliced</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can Italian-style whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon file powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water and chicken in large pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is tender, about
            1 hour. Using tongs, transfer chicken to strainer and cool, saving cooking liquid. Remove meat from bones in
            pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy skillet over medium heat. Add okra and cook until no longer sticky, stirring
            frequently, about 20 minutes; set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir flour and remaining 1/2 cup oil in heavy large Dutch oven. Cook over medium heat until deep golden
            brown, stirring frequently, about 6 minutes. Add 4 cups reserved chicken cooking broth, okra, andouille
            sausage, tomatoes with their juices, bell pepper, celery, garlic, bay leaf, salt, thyme, basil, cayenne, and
            pepper. Cover partially and simmer until thickened, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Spoon off any fat from surface of gumbo. Add chicken and file powder to gumbo and simmer gently 15 minutes.
            (If preparing ahead, cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before serving.) Mound rice in shallow bowls if
            desired. Ladle gumbo over and serve.</li>
    </ol>
